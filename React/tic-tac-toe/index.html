<!--
    Images in the public folder are made publicly available by the underlying project development server & build
    process. Navigate to them when the project is running by using a URL like http://localhost:5173/game-logo.png
    
    The src/assets folder is not made publicly available but can be used by code files. Images imported into code
    files are then picked up by the underlying build process, potentially optimized, and kind of "injected" into
    the public folder right before serving the website. Links to those images are automatically generated and used
    in the places where you referenced the imported images.
    
    Use the public folder for any images that should not be handled by the build process and that should be generally
    available. Good candidates are images used directly in the index.html file or favicons. On the other hand, images
    that are used inside of components should typically be stored in the src/ folder (e.g., in src/assets).
